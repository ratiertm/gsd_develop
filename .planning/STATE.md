## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5-phase build order derived from COM/OCX dependency chain -- API foundation before orders, orders before strategy, risk co-built with orders
- Roadmap: Phase 4 (GUI) and Phase 5 (Backtest) can run in parallel since both depend on Phase 3 but not each other

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 may need research into Kiwoom SendOrder API details (sHogaGb codes, OnReceiveChejanData gubun values)
- Phase 5 may need research into Kiwoom historical data API (opt10080/opt10081) limitations
